      John has 18,000 hours of pilot experience.  Most of those hours were
      flying helicopters.  His helicopter pilot experience includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Armed combat in Vietnam</li>
      <li>Venison hunting and recovery in New Zealand’s Southern Alps</li>
      <li>Commercial operations such as Agricultural application, external lifting, surveying, etc.</li>
      <li>Private fun flying</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But the bulk of his experience has been in training people like you to become
      helicopter pilots.  John is also a FAA Designated Pilot Examiner.  This allows
      him to administer helicopter pilot flight tests and issue pilot certificates
      and ratings.

    <p>
      Simon has been flying helicopters since 2008, and instructing since 2010.
      Between 2009 and 2012 he completed a three-year apprenticeship as an Airframe
      and Power-plant Mechanic, and in December 2012 he received his A&P certificate
      after a 16 hour examination.  Although he prefers flying, he views an
      understanding of the mechanical operation of aircraft to be as important as
      “cyclic and collective” skills.  From 2011-2012 he completed transition
      training, adding on airplane ratings to his helicopter certificates.  He has
      over 1,000 flight hours the vast majority of which are in helicopters.

    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, Dan has experience with a wide range of types of flight, including
      aerobatics, formation flying, off-airport operations, and ferry flights.  Dan’s
      experience combined with his technical background allows him to contribute deep
      understanding of the flight environment as well as the theory of flight, on top
      of the cyclic and collective flying skills.  Dan provides instrument training in
      both helicopters and airplanes, and specializes in technically advanced aircraft
      (“glass cockpit” aircraft – like our Raven II).
