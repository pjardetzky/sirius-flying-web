      John has 18,000 hours of pilot experience.  Most of those hours were
      flying helicopters.  His helicopter pilot experience includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Armed combat in Vietnam</li>
      <li>Venison hunting and recovery in New Zealand’s Southern Alps</li>
      <li>Commercial operations such as Agricultural application, external lifting, surveying, etc.</li>
      <li>Private fun flying</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But the bulk of his experience has been in training people like you to become
      helicopter pilots.  John is also a FAA Designated Pilot Examiner.  This allows
      him to administer helicopter pilot flight tests and issue pilot certificates
      and ratings.

    <p>
      Simon has been flying helicopters since 2008, and instructing since 2010.
      Between 2009 and 2012 he completed a three-year apprenticeship as an Airframe
      and Powerplant Mechanic, and in December 2012 he received his A&P certificate
      after a 16 hour examination.  Although he prefers flying, he views an
      understanding of the mechanical operation of aircraft to be as important as
      “cyclic and collective” skills.  From 2011-2012 he completed transition
      training, adding on airplane ratings to his helicopter certificates.  He has
      over 1,000 flight hours the vast majority of which are in helicopters.
