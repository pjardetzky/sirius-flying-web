<h1>Discovery Flight</h1>
<br>
<p>
The Discovery Flight Lesson is a 40 minute flight in the R44 Raven
II helicopter preceded by a half-hour safety briefing.  The flight
includes some straight-and-level instruction as you fly across the
San Francisco Bay to a beautiful area of hills and valleys.  There
your instructor pilot will demonstrate off-airport operations.  On
the way back, you will experience a gentle auto-rotative glide.
Returning to Palo Alto, he will spend the rest of the time
familiarizing you with hovering the helicopter.  During much of the
flight you will be allowed to use individual controls.
</p>
 
<p>Another person (or 2) may fly with us to observe, if you wish.
</p>
 
<p>The standard Discovery Flight in the R44 Raven II helicopter is $390.
</p>
 
<p>It is possible to take the Discovery Flight Lesson at less cost
if you weigh less than 240 pounds, and you do not wish to have
anyone accompany us on the flight.  In that case, the flight in the
Robinson R22 Beta II helicopter is $290.  The R22 is somewhat less
stable and more demanding to fly and hover than the R44.
</p>
  
<p>Allow 2 hours to include the ground time.
</p>

<br>
<p> This is a great cost-effective opportunity for those who are
still determining whether to pursue helicopter training or just
want to experience being at the controls of a helicopter.
