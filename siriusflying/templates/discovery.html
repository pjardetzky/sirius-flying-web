<h1>Discovery Flight</h1>
<br>
<p>
Are you interested in flying a helicopter? Want to try and fly a
helicopter? Get HANDS ON experiences at the controls!
</p>
<ul>
<li class="padded"> You will get the chance to manipulate the controls of a
  helicopter in flight, get a demonstration of the uniqueness of
  helicopters, and the perspective of a life time.</li>
<li class="padded">Bring an observer. Bring a friend, a co-worker, or a spouse.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Flight Details</h1>
<br>
<p>
The Discovery Flight is 45 minutes of flight instruction preceded by a half-hour
safety briefing.
</p>

<p>
During the flight portion, you will control the heading and speed of the
helicopter as it crosses the bay en-route to a beautiful area north of Calaveras
Reservoir.  There, I will demonstrate off-airport operations and auto-rotation
(the helicopter glide).
</p>

<p>
Returning to Palo Alto, we will spend the rest of the time learning how to hover
the helicopter 5 feet above the ground.  The flight is actual training which can
be credited towards a pilot's certificate.  We will issue a starter log-book
with an official record of the flight.
