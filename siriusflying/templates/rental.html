<h1>Helicopter Rental</h1>
<br>
<p>
Our fleet consists of R22 and R44 helicopters.  Sirius Flying LLC is the only
helicopter flight operation in the Bay Area that grants rental privileges in the
Robinson R44 Raven II.
</p>
<p>
If you hold a Rotorcraft-Helicopter license issued by the FAA, you may rent a
helicopter from us after a thorough check-out procedure by our chief flight
instructor.  Check-out requirements are determined on an individual basis
according the individual's background, experience and state of currency and
proficiency.
</p>
<p>
As a renter, you are required to stay current by flying at least twice every
thirty days and you must complete a re-currency check every three months.  In
addition, we require that all licensed pilots renting with us attend the <a
class="sirius-links"
href="http://www.robinsonheli.com/rhc_pilots_safety_course.html"
target="_">ROBINSON FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR SAFETY COURSE</a> once every two years.
</p>
<p>
We are committed to your continued proficiency and pilot safety, so you can
spend more time enjoying time in the air; alone or with your passengers.
